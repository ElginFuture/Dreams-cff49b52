# Getting me Started
I am creating a conversational experience using Microsoft Bot Framework project. For my project to work, it needs Azure resources including Language Understanding. Below are the steps to create these resources.

1. Using the Azure portal, please create a Language Understanding resource.
2. Once created, securely share the resulting credentials with me as described in the link below.
